Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Septerium
=============================

My name is Johnny Gomes (also called Septerium), I'm a full-stack developer with 11+ years designing and developing digital systems. My focus for the past few years has centered around Java backend development using the Spring Framework and frontend development with React and Svelte. My journey also involves C++ and CUDA-powered applications in numerical methods and high-performance computing. Additionally, I have a passion for robotics, electronics and automation. If bytes, gears, and elegant solutions resonate with you, let's connect and collaborate! ðŸš€
